# BrainPy binder

This guide will walk you through the process of using BrainPy with Binder, an online platform that allows you to interact with Jupyter notebooks in your web browser without needing to install anything locally. BrainPy is a flexible, efficient, and extensible framework for computational neuroscience and brain-inspired computation based on the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. By following these steps, you can quickly start using BrainPy in a Binder environment.

## Step 1: Launch Binder Environment
Click on the following link to launch the Binder environment with the BrainPy repository:

Wait for the Binder environment to build. This might take a few moments.

Once the environment is ready, you'll be redirected to a Jupyter notebook interface within your web browser.

## Step 2: Accessing BrainPy Examples
In the Jupyter notebook interface, you'll see a list of files. These files are the quickstart examples cover a range of topics related to neural modeling, simulation, training and analysis.

Click on the example notebook you're interested in, and it will open in a new tab. You can now interact with the notebook, run code cells, and explore the BrainPy functionality.

## Step 3: Running the Example Notebook
Within the notebook, you'll see code cells containing BrainPy code snippets and explanations.

To run a code cell, click on it to select it, and then either press the "Run" button in the toolbar at the top of the page or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.

Observe the output generated by the code cells, which may include visualizations, plots, or numerical results.

Feel free to modify the code cells, experiment with different parameters, and observe the effects on the simulations.

## Step 4: Interacting with BrainPy
As you run the example notebook's code cells, you'll gain hands-on experience with BrainPy's features and capabilities.

BrainPy provides a variety of functions and classes for building and simulating brain dynamics models. The example notebooks will showcase different aspects of these functionalities.

Take the time to read the comments, explanations, and documentation provided within the example notebook. This will help you understand the underlying concepts and how BrainPy works.

## Conclusion
Using BrainPy with Binder provides a convenient way to learn and experiment with brain modeling using BrainPy without needing to install anything on your local machine. Have fun exploring the examples and gaining insights into the world of computational neuroscience!
